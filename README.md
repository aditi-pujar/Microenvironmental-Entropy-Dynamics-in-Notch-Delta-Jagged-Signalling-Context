# Microenvironmental-Entropy-Dynamics-in-Notch-Delta-Jagged-Signalling-Context

This is the complete set of codes and figures associated with (Barua, Pujar et al. 2023)

There are two primary sets of results - the first of purely LEUP simulations (./LEUP_simulation_results) and the second of calculating beta from Notch Delta Jagged simulations (./LEUP_NDJ_calculating_beta). The codes required to generate the datasets and subsequent analyses are explained in each individual directory.

The figures of the manuscript are contained in ./figures
